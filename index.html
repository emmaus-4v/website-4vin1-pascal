                For Honor is an action fighting game set during a medieval, fantasy setting. Players can play as a character from one of four different factions,
                namely the Iron Legion (Knights), the Warborn (Vikings), the Dawn Empire (Samurai), and the Wu Lin (Ancient Chinese). The Wu Lin faction was added 
                in the Marching Fire expansion in October 2018. Each hero also has quotes in their own language that will trigger when certain actions are performed. 
                The Knights speak Latin, the Vikings speak Icelandic, the Samurai speak Japanese, and the Wu Lin speak Mandarin. Each faction had four classes at 
                launch, with two more being added at the beginning of every season of the Faction War. The Vanguard class is described as "well-balanced" and has 
                excellent offense and defense. The Assassin class is fast and efficient in dueling enemies, but the class deals much less damage to multiple enemies. 
                The Heavies (Tanks) are more resistant to damage and are suitable for holding capture points, though their attacks are slow. The last class, known as 
                "Hybrid", is a combination of two of the three types, and is capable of using uncommon skills.

                <br/> <br/>

                All heroes are unique and have their own weapons, skills, and fighting styles. Players fight against their opponents with their class-specific melee 
                weapons. When players perform certain actions, such as killing multiple enemies consecutively, they gain Feats, which are additional perks. These perks 
                allow players to gain additional points and strengths, call in a barrage of arrows or a catapult attack, or heal themselves. In most missions, players 
                are accompanied by numerous AI minions. They are significantly weaker than the player character, and do not pose much threat.

                <br/> <br/>

                A tactical combat system, known as "Art of Battle", is initiated when the player encounters other players or player-like AI in the multiplayer or higher 
                health AI in the campaign. Players enter a dueling mode with them wherein players aim at their opponent with their weapon. Players then can choose how 
                to place and position their weapons from three directions (from above, the right, and the left) when they are attacking their enemies. By observing 
                on-screen hints and the movements of their opponents, which reflect their respective attack position, players are able to choose the correct position to 
                block the other players' attacks. Players also have other special abilities, which vary depending on the character they choose, such as barging into 
                enemies with their own shoulders and performing back-stepping swipes. The strength of each attack can also be decided by players. The system aims at 
                allowing players to "feel the weight of the weapon in their hand".
