                        Duel Mode is a 1v1 multiplayer match. Players can battle other players or opt to battle an AI (game controlled hero). In this game. players pit against each other in a show of strength and skill. Friends who desire to battle each other, will initially need to be in a group. This can be done in the Social menu. Players will then need to create a custom match. Players will need to use the matchmaking system to find other opponents. Duel Practice is available under the How To Play option in the main menu.

                        Brawl Mode is a 2v2 multiplayer match. Teammates do not start in the same area of the map, although they are relatively nearby. Each player is matched up with their own opponent to defeat before heading off to assist their teammate. Players are not locked into defeating their own enemy first, but it does appear to be the way the match was designed to be played.

                        Dominion is a 4v4 multiplayer match. In this mode, two teams of four players will spawn on a random map. Inside the map are three zones to be taken and controlled. Controlling a zone and defeating enemies earns points for the team. After a team has reached 1000 points, the opposing team "breaks" and the fight is to the death. The breaking team members will no longer be able to respawn. Points will continue to accumulate until a team is defeated. The side with the most points wins.
